    - Henry Ford
    <p class="letter">Hello,<br>
      <br>
      My name is Vitaliy Porsnev, I was born in a small European country called Lithuania, in the capital city - Vilnius.
      Both of my parents are coming from Russia, so I have been living in bilingual setting since the early childhood.
      Additionally, since pre-school I started learning English language, and thanks to my huge interest in travelling, cars, games, technology and hundreds of hours spent on the internet reading and watching everything concerning those topics,
      I was able to easily communicate in English by the time I started my high-school.
      <br>
      <br>
      My experience in warehousing and gastronomy in Lithuania matured me in business atmosphere and handling stressful
      situations. It gave me the self-confidence I needed to travel abroad in order to broaden my knowledge and skills and get the international experience.
      <br>
      <br>
      Recently, with the help of online studying plaforms like Udemy and Codeacademy I decided to learn additional, such useful in modern age subjects as software and web development. This very web site you are browsing right now is the first fruit of my studies.

          <h3>In my high-school years I was very energetic and creative and have been a presentor for every school event and a member of Vilnius actors agency.
            And therefore, my first ever job was acting. I had a few roles in multiple advertisements and in full-lenght film by Oscar-winning italian director Gabriele Salvatores called "Siberian Education".</h3>

          <h3 class="testimonial-text">After this overhelming experience I had to land a more down to earth job. I have became a warehouse worker for a local franchise of international furniture manufacturer "Komandor". Shortly, after around half a year I was promoted to a warehouse
          manager position. During that time I effectively changed the physical layout and stock and storage control of the warehouse.</h3>

          <h3 class="testimonial-text">Eventually, half a year later I got an offer to work as a sales manager for a logistcs company named "Portus Logistika" and decided to accept it and move on.
          Even though I had huge interest to the field I was working in, my work day was all about cold-calling companies from Russia and Kazakhstan. And, to be honest, I was pretty bad at it and felt zero motivation. That is why, after short three
          months I learnt my lesson and left the company.</h3>

          <h3 class="testimonial-text">This is when a new chapter of my working experience began - gastronomy business. In may 2014 I started working as a waiter for a famous and long-standing restaurant in the very heart of Vilnius city - called "Zoe's Bar & Grill". The direct
          contact, ability to be helpful and meet new people made me feel like home.
          My hard work, time management abilities and will to be involved more was soon recognised by the general manager of the restaurant and as soon as managers position was open I was promoted.
          In my new position I had a wide variety of tasks, including human resourcing, social media management, stock control, data management etc. and of course the most important part - welcoming guests and overseeing service by the high standarts. I
          stayed with the company another three years until september 2017.</h3>
